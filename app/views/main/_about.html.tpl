        <p class="gen">With a long history in the marketing of condos and apartments, the Pistilli Realty group is proud to be the <strong>premier</strong> provider of rental properties in <strong><em>New York City</em></strong>.</p>
        <div>
          <h3>What Makes Pistilli Stand Out?</h3>
          <p>The Pistilli Realty group has built its group of New York rentals on quality customer service and family values.</p>
          <p>We’re a company built on history and tradition, one that is still family-owned after being founded in Astoria, New York, by a group of hard-working Italian immigrants.</p>
          <p>Here at Pistilli, we know that our name and how we’re perceived in the community is what can drive or damage our business, so we’re dedicated to the best in customer service and satisfaction in all of our commercial ventures – from rentals and condos to real estate development and banking.</p>

          <h3>What Does Pistilli Do Differently than the Other Guys?</h3>
          <p>At Pistilli, we’ve developed a unique way of looking at apartments and rentals in New York City. Instead of starting with cookie-cutter buildings and the same apartment layout repeated again and again, we’ve sought out some of the most unique buildings in five boroughs and turned them into living spaces that possess not only charm, but also a sense of luxury that is missing from many family apartments and condos for young and professional New Yorkers.</p>
          <p>We’re committed to revitalizing what makes New York great and then giving our customers the chance to put down roots in a new home that provides not only all of the creature comforts they want, but also at a price they can afford.</p>

          <h3>Where Is Pistilli Going in the Future?</h3>
          <p>Pistilli is proud to welcome its third generation of managers and owners into the fold, people who are able to provide service at all of our rentals across the city and to give our customers access to some of the best support and management in the business.</p>
          <p>Our condos stand out, our rentals are unique, and our business is all about making sure our customers are at home in each of the properties we own.</p>
