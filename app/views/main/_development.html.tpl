        <p class="gen">Construction and development are always high priorities here at Pistilli as we seek to offer the <strong>best</strong> in unique and affordable <strong><em>New York</em></strong> rentals.</p>
        <p class="more">When it comes to the real estate market in New York, experience makes the difference – the experience to know <strong>where</strong> and <strong>when</strong> to buy, <strong>what</strong> to rent, and <strong>how</strong> to develop. We’re Pistilli, and we’re a family-owned business that has made its mark on the New York rentals scene, not only with our great apartments and condos, but also by constructing, renovating, and developing some of the best properties in the city.</p>

          <h3>Expanding the Rentals Market</h3>
          <p>One of the best things about renting with Pistilli is that we offer a suite of properties that are unique among New York's boroughs. From warehouses to mercantile areas, we’ve taken properties that no other company was interested in and turned them into apartments and condos that are not the same as others in the area, ones that have been duplicated time after time.</p>
          <p>We have a keen eye for construction and renovation of interesting properties in New York, ones that we can transform into bright and friendly spaces that our tenants are pleased to call home.</p>

          <h3>Developing a New Way to Rent</h3>
          <p>Aside from the construction of new and exciting condos and rentals, we’re also committed to developing properties that we already own and to honoring the renters we have. We know that both professionals and families are seeking apartments to call home, ones that are not only well-maintained but that are continually being improved to better meet their needs.</p>
          <p>New York apartments are difficult enough to find in locations that are desirable, let alone at a price many young families or professionals just beginning their careers can afford. At Pistilli, we’re not only developing the physical aspects of our rentals, but we're also making sure we can offer great rates to our new and existing renters, giving them a leg up in the New York real estate market.</p>
